# Creating Web API in ASP.NET Core 2.0

## Introduction

Let's create a Web API with the latest version of ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core.

In this guide, we'll use WideWorldImporters database to create a Web API.

REST APIs provide at least the following operations:

* GET
* POST
* PUT
* DELETE

There are other operations for REST, but they aren't necessary for this guide.

Those operations allow clients to perform actions through REST API, so our Web API must contain those operations.

WideWorldImporters database contains 4 schemas:

Application
Purchasing
Sales
Warehouse

In this guide, we'll work with Warehouse.StockItems table. We'll add code to work with this entity: allow to retrieve stock items, retrieve stock item by id, create, update and delete stock items from database.

The version for this API is 1.

This is the route table for API:

|Verb|Url|Description|
|GET|api/v1/Warehouse/StockItem|Retrieves stock items|
|GET|api/v1/Warehouse/StockItem/id|Retrieves a stock item by id|
|POST|api/v1/Warehouse/StockItem|Creates a new stock item|
|PUT|api/v1/Warehouse/StockItem/id|Updates an existing stock item|
|DELETE|api/v1/Warehouse/StockItem/id|Deletes an existing stock item|

Keep these routes in mind because API must implement all routes.
